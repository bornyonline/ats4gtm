LiveRamp's Authenticated Traffic Solution (ATS) is a privacy-safe, transparent solution rooted in first-party reader authentications. ATS delivers enhanced addressability, better consumer visibility, and more user control across the open internet. ATS makes it possible for publishers to add people-based identity to advertising inventory, connecting those users directly with marketers. 

Publishers can implement ATS easily to your web properties directly or Google Tag Manager.
